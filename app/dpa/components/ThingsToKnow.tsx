            Essex Mortgage has a proprietary National Down Payment Assistance Product available in 49 states that can be a great fit for both retail and wholesale channels. Our National DPA products is helping thousands of families enjoy homeownership across the country. As we start 2025, many companies are looking for products that can enhance market share without being a loss leader. With the market outlook of higher rates for longer, and many highly qualified buyers on the sidelines for now, our DPA is mitigating some of that decreased demand enabling more buyers to qualify to purchase a home with less cash out of pocket. This product also can help meet CRA requirements. Essex is the market leader, and both securitizes and services our DPA laons, which allows us to be a price leader as well.
